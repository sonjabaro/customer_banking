# customer_banking
### This is week 3 challenge submission which applied the learnings of using Object Oriented Programming and Python.

### The starter code was downloaded from BCS and is named "M3_Starter_Code2".  I stored this in the main folder of Customer Banking. I edited the code that was in these folders per the instructions and you can run the program using the "customer_banking".py file.

### I've included a screenshot of the program running successfully during my code review with Kevin, one of our T.A.s.

### The concepts in this exercise include using pre-defined functions from other files (account) and passing values into the variables present in different code folders using the set function.  All this is made possible by initializing the functions we share across folders and referring to the correct paths for the code.

### While completing this exercise I utilized viewing recorded class sessions, review past activities, TA time, and study groups with other classmates.
### I think the trickiest part of this challenge was not to overcomplicate it, and the setting of the base values for the functions to use.  It was awkward to build the code without having input of the user till later to allow testing and debugging.
